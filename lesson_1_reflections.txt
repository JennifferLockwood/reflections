I did not have to go through the all file to fine the bug. Also, it was easy to
fix the bug after I saw what were the differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
You can fix bugs easier and faster, maybe. You can control changes and see
what kind of changes you did.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like
Google Docs does?
Pros: You decide when and why to create a commit. You can describe the changes
that have been done.
Cons: If you forget to do it for a long time, maybe you are loosing some
changes. Commits too long to understand or remember what you did.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file
separately?
I think it's easy to track the changes when you can have all the files
related, because it's going to make your work a little bit easy.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
With git log I can see all the commits, and with git diff I can see the
differences between the commits I'm interested to compare.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
Version control allows me to return to previous version if I need it. In that
case, if a break something, I can go back to the version that is not broken.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to try using Git for my projects in the Front-End Developer nanodegree.
