What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
I can put files in the staging area without the necessity of moving or deleting
files from my working directory. I think this offers me the possibility of
controlling my files and, of course, my commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
Using the git diff --staged to check my commits.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?
I can substantial changes to my project without affecting my original idea.
With branches it's possible to play more with creative options of different
features of a project.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They help me to have a clearer idea of what is happening between the branches
and the master, and I understood how git log is showing the commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
The result in the master branch with the changes that were in the other branch.
You represent the diagram in that way to understand what it is happening and
to have a more clear idea about the whole process.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
I need to practice more this to know pros and cons of Git's merging. So far, I
think that is a pretty cool thing.
