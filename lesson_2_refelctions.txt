What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
I can put files in the staging area without the necessity of moving or deleting
files from my working directory. I think this offers me the possibility of
controlling my files and, of course, my commits.
