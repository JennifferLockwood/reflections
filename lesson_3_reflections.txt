When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keepin all your
work local?
To have a project that is going to change in the near future, for example a
web site.  Also it's very useful if I'm working in a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I think it's a better way to control changes, and when I need to see the
history, it'll be easy to understand what I did in that moment. If Git does
automatically, maybe it's going to pull changes that are not ready.
